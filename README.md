 ## Uniform Git
 
 A Chrome extension that let's you focus only on developing things rather than increasing commits.  
 I see people usually push a lot of code just to increase their number of commits. This extension will help to not look for the graph in anyone's profile.
 
 ### Motivation
 My friend who used to push useless commits to a private repository just to increase the number of contribution and make his contribution graph look cool!ðŸ˜‰

 ### Want to Contribute?
 
 The project is not over yet. There're even cool things that could be done to manipulate the existing GitHub and concerntrate on your code!  
 You can raise a feature request by opening an issue, or can make PR for any contribution that you feel could be added to this!
